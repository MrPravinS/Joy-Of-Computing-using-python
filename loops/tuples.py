# myTuple = (1,2,3) * 2
# # print(myTuple)
# print(myTuple[0])
# # myTuple[0] = 12  give error bcos Tuple are immutable
# print(myTuple)


# Repetition
repeated_tuple = (1, 2) * 3
print(repeated_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2)


# Membership Testing
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(2 in my_tuple)  # Output: True
print(5 in my_tuple)  # Output: False

# Length:
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)
print(len(my_tuple))  # Output: 4
