# Tuples in python
# Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable, allow duplicate values.

# thisTupel = ("Pravin","Ajay","Vijay","Pravin")
# print(len (thisTupel))

# One item tuple, remember the comma:

# myTuple = ("pravin")
# print( type (myTuple))  # data type = <class str>

# myTuple = ("pravin",)   # give (,) for one item
# print( type (myTuple))  # data type = <class tuple>

# tuples = ("aj",1,True,5)
# print(tuples[-2])
